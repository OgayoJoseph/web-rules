Typefaces Rules (Guideline).

1.Use only good & popular typefaces and play it safe;

Examples (from Google Fonts, Font Squirrel);

Sans-serif; (Inter, Open sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work sans, Lato) are free fonts

Serif; (Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora) are free fonts

2.Use just one typeface per page, if more is needed limit to 2 typeface.
3.Choose the right typeface according to website personality.

{
*choose right personality for website (later on lecture)
*Deside between serif & sans-serif typefaces
*Experiment with all "good" typefaces (and others from Google font) to see which one best fits your website message. (developed over time with experience)
*Keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page

- }

  4.When choosing font-size limit choices (Use a "typescale" tool or other pre defined range)
  5.Font-size between 16px-32px for normal text.
  6.For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger.
  7.For headlines you can go really big (50px) and bold (600+), depending on personality.
  8.For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular).

{Reading Experience}
9.Use less than 75 characters per line.
10.For normal sized text use a line height between 1.5 & 2. For big text, go below 1.5.

NB=The small or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be.

11.Describe letter spacing in headline, if it looks unnatural (comes with experience).
12.Experiment with all caps for short titles. Makes them small & bold & increase letter-spacing.
13.Usually don't justify text.
Don't center long text blocks, small blocks are fine.
