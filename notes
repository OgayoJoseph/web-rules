Web Design:TYPOGRAPHY;

Def; The art and technique of arranging type to make written language LEGIBLE, READABLE, & APPEALING when displayed (applied) {wikipedia defination}

Serif vs Sans-Serif.

Serif typeface.
-Create a traditional/Classic look & feel.
-Conveys trustworthiness.
-Good for long texts.

Sans-Serif tyeface.
-Mordern look and feel.
-Clean & Simple.
-Easier to choose for begginer designers.

Typefaces Rules (Guideline).

1.Use only good & popular typefaces and play it safe;

Examples (from Google Fonts, Font Squirrel);

Sans-serif; (Inter, Open sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work sans, Lato) are free fonts

Serif; (Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora) are free fonts

2.Use just one typeface per page, if more is needed limit to 2 typeface.

3.Choose the right typeface according to website personality.

{-choose right personality for website (later on lecture)
-Deside between serif & sans-serif typefaces
-Experiment with all "good" typefaces (and others from Google font) to see which one best fits your website message. (developed over time with experience)
-Keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page}

4.When choosing font-size limit choices (Use a "typescale" tool or other pre defined range).

5.Font-size between 16px-32px for normal text.

6.For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger.

7.For headlines you can go really big (50px) and bold (600+), depending on personality.

8.For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular).

{Reading Experience}
9.Use less than 75 characters per line.

10.For normal sized text use a line height between 1.5 & 2. For big text, go below 1.5.

NB=The small or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be.

11.Describe letter spacing in headline, if it looks unnatural (comes with experience).

12.Experiment with all caps for short titles. Makes them small & bold & increase letter-spacing.

13.Usually don't justify text.

14.Don't center long text blocks, small blocks are fine.

Web Design: COLORS;

1.Make the main color MATCH YOUR WEBSITE'S PERSONALITY: colors convey meaning!

-Red: symbolizes power, passion & excitement.
-Orange: conveys happiness, cheerfulness and creativity.
-Yellow: joy, brightness, intelligence.
-Green:harmony, nature, growth & health.
-Blue: peace, trustworthiness, professionalism.
-Purple: wealth, wisdom, magic.
-Pink: romance, care, affection.
-Brown: nature, durability and comfort.
-Black: power, elegance, minimalism {also grief and sorrow.}

2.Use a GOOD COLOR TONE! Don't choose random tone or CSS named colors TOOLBOX{Open color, tailwindcss,Flat UI colors 2}.

Establishing a Color System.

3.You need at least 2 types of color palette; i.e main color and grey color.

4.With experience you can add accent colors as well TOOLBOX{palleton.com, coolors}

-Main color and grey color shoul complement each other and play off each other's tone and darkness.

-Make sure the accent color has a relation with the main color. using toolbox color {no.2}.

5.For diversity, create lighter and darker "versions" (tints and shades) {tint[Lighter] shades [Darker]}. TOOLBOX{Tint & Shade Generator}

WHen and How to Use Colors.

6.Use your color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page. i.e {button, logo,}

7.Color add interesting accents making the entire components or sections stand out.

8.Colors can be used strategically in images and illustrations.

Colors and Typography.

9.On dark colored backgrounds, try to use tints of the background ("lighter version") for text.

10.Text should not be completely black. Lighten it up {appears more inviting}.

11.Don't make text too light! Use tool to check contrast between text and background colors. TOOLBOX{coolors}.

NB=Contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18px+).

Web Desing Rules; Images and Illustrations.

Use Good Images;

1.Different types of images: product photos,storytelling photos, illustration, patterns.

-Product; Illustrate item to be sold on the website.
-Storytelling; Convey message (using product etc.).
-Illustration; Abstract way to tell story, help bring story.
-Patterns; Add intresting visual details and creativity. {don't over do!!}

2.Use images to support your website's message & story. ONLY!! relevant images.

3.Prefer original images. if not possible, use original-looking stock images (avoid generic images) TOOLBOX{Unsplash [prefered], Pexels, DrawKit, unDraw}.

Use Images Well.

4.Try to show real People to trigger user's emotions.

5.If necessary, crop images to fit your message.

6.Experiments combining photos, illustration and patterns.

Handling Text on Images.

7.Method #1: Darken or Brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient).

8.Method #2: Position text into neutral image area.

9.Method #3: Put text in a box.

Some Technical Details.

10.To account for high-res screens, make images dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size.

-This is achieved by using scale factor.
SCALE FACTOR: Actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels represented on screen.

-On high-res screens, scale factor is 2 times or even 3 times (latest high-res phones), on "normal" screens it's just 1 times (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel).

11.Compress images for lower file size and better performance. TOOLBOX {Squoosh}.

12.When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact same dimensions.

Web Design Rules: Icons.

Use good icons.

1.Use a good icon pack, there's a variety of icon packs both paid and free. TOOLBOX{Phosphor icons, ionicons, ICONS8}

2.Use only one icon pack. mixing icon is not a good practice.

3.Use SVG icons or Icon fonts. using bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png!)

-SVG images and icon font are vector-based.
-Can be scaled indefinitely!
-Don't get pixelated.
-.jpg, png, gif don't scale and become unsharp.

4.Choosing icons should be based on your website personality! ROUNDNESS, WEIGHT and FILLED/OUTLINED depending on typography.

When to use icons.

5.Provide [visual assistance] to text.

6.Use icons for [product feature blocks]

7.Use icons [associated with actions], and [label them] (unless no space or icon is 100% clear).

8.Use icons as[bullet points]

How to use icon well.

9.Keep icon neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, use different color.

10.Don't confuse users;icons need to make sense and fit the text or action.

11.Don't make icon larger than they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape.

Web Design Rules: Shadows.

Some Consepts;

Shadow history;

-Product had [Skeuomorphic-Design] which had a glossy effect and lots of shadows.
-Windows & Mac-IOs striped this design for a flat design[minimal]

-Recently a phenomenal dubbed ["Flat-Design-2.0"] has emerged, still with minimal flat design but drings back shadows and depth for better usability.

-After an era of 100% flat design, we're now back to using shadows in UI design (aka "Flat Design 2.0")
-Shadows create depth (3D): the more shadow, the further away from the interface the element is.
-Shadows can be udes on boxes and text.

Use of shadows well;

1.Dont have to use shadows! Only use them it it makes sense for the website personality.

2.Use shadows in small doses.

3.Go light on shadows, don't make them too dark.

When to use shadow;

4.Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention).

5.Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more.

6.Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface.

7.Experiment with changing shadowson mouse interaction (click and hover)/

-medum-sized shadow "pulls" button closer to the user.
-small-r shadow "pushes" button back into the interface.

8.Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows).

Web Design Rules: Border-Radius.

Use Border-Radius Well.

1.Use border-radius to increase the playfulness and fun of the design, to make it less serious.

2.Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that the border-radius matches that roundness.

Where to Use Border Radius.

3.Use border-radius on [buttons], [images], [around-icons], [standout-sections] and other elements.

Web Design Rules: Whitespace.

Why whitespace; -right amount makes design look clean, mordern and polished.
-Also communicates different pieces of information are related to one another.
-Implies invisible relationship between the elements of a layout.

Where to use white space;

1.Use tons of whitespace between sections.

2.Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements.

3.Use whitespace between elements.

4.Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines.

How much Whitespace;

5.The more some elements (or groups of elements) belong together, the closer they should be! ['Law-of-Proximity'].

6.Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much! then remove whitespace from there.
-Too much whitespace looks detached, too little looks too crammed.

7.Match other design choises. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace.

8.Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing.

Web Design Rules; Visual Hierarchy.
