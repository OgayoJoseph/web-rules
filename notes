Typefaces Rules (Guideline).

1.Use only good & popular typefaces and play it safe;

Examples (from Google Fonts, Font Squirrel);

Sans-serif; (Inter, Open sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work sans, Lato) are free fonts

Serif; (Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora) are free fonts

2.Use just one typeface per page, if more is needed limit to 2 typeface.

3.Choose the right typeface according to website personality.

{-choose right personality for website (later on lecture)
-Deside between serif & sans-serif typefaces
-Experiment with all "good" typefaces (and others from Google font) to see which one best fits your website message. (developed over time with experience)
-Keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page}

4.When choosing font-size limit choices (Use a "typescale" tool or other pre defined range).

5.Font-size between 16px-32px for normal text.

6.For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger.

7.For headlines you can go really big (50px) and bold (600+), depending on personality.

8.For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular).

9.Use less than 75 characters per line.

10.For normal sized text use a line height between 1.5 & 2. For big text, go below 1.5.

NB=The small or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be.

-This is achieved by using scale factor.
SCALE FACTOR: Actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels represented on screen.

-On high-res screens, scale factor is 2 times or even 3 times (latest high-res phones), on "normal" screens it's just 1 times (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel).
